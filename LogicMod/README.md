# PalworldResourceESP LogicMod Source

This directory stores only project-owned LogicMod assets and documentation. The full Palworld Modding Kit, Unreal Engine, Wwise integration, generated caches, and packaged Windows project remain outside this repository.

## Expected Asset Layout

```text
Content/
  Mods/
    PalworldResourceESP/
      ModActor.uasset
      BP_ESPBridge.uasset
      WBP_ESPOverlay.uasset
      WBP_ESPPanel.uasset
      PalworldResourceESP.uasset
```

The assets will be created in Unreal Engine after the external PMK toolchain compiles successfully. `PalworldResourceESP.uasset` is the Primary Asset Label for a unique non-zero chunk.

The repository is the source of record for the editor-only generator. Sync it into an existing external PMK with an explicit path; the command creates a dated rollback copy before replacing any PMK file:

```powershell
./tools/logicmod/Sync-LogicModTooling.ps1 -PmkRoot <PalworldModdingKit-no-wwise>
```

## Bridge Contract

- Bridge discovery: Lua observes the passive `ModActor_C` through `RegisterBeginPlayPostHook`
- Lua to Blueprint: `PalworldResourceESP_ResetSession`
- Lua to Blueprint: `PalworldResourceESP_SetTarget`
- Lua to Blueprint: `PalworldResourceESP_ClearTarget`
- Lua to Blueprint: `PalworldResourceESP_TogglePanel`

`SetTarget` appends one already accepted wild Pal to the overlay target array and ignores duplicates. `ClearTarget` empties that array without recreating the overlay, and `ResetSession` removes the overlay before a new world session. The overlay uses one `OnPaint` pass to project and draw every accepted target up to `MAX_DISPLAY_TARGETS`.

`PostBeginPlay` must remain passive. Runtime testing showed that a packaged Blueprint call to a UE4SS custom event with `self` crashes during startup, while Lua discovery followed by Lua-to-Blueprint calls survives gameplay, return to title, and normal exit.

Blueprint receives only `PalMonsterCharacter` instances already accepted by the Lua acquisition boundary. It must not scan actors, enumerate players, or accept a player object from another path.

Gender enum access remains entirely inside Blueprint. The overlay normalizes `EPalGenderType` to `ESP_GenderDiagnosticCode` (`0=unknown`, `1=male`, `2=female`), and `ModActor` exposes only that integer as `ESP_BridgeGenderDiagnosticCode`. Lua maps the integer to diagnostic text; it must not read the enum or the compatibility `FString` property.

Dead targets are filtered at both lifecycle speeds: Lua rejects `PalCharacterParameterComponent:IsDead()` during snapshot rebuild, and the Widget calls `PalUtility::IsDead` before drawing each frame. Capture/ownership transitions are removed by the next classification snapshot.

## Panel Contract

`Shift+E` is registered by Lua and calls `PalworldResourceESP_TogglePanel` on the passive `ModActor`. The panel is Chinese by default and can switch its labels to English. It owns no discovery or player-classification logic.

The panel writes only `ESP_RuntimeEnabled`, `ESP_ProfileId`, `ESP_PresetId`, `ESP_CaptureRequested`, and the monotonically increasing `ESP_ControlRevision`. Lua polls these scalar properties every 250 ms. It never accepts a Blueprint-to-Lua callback from the panel, because that event direction caused a reproducible startup crash in the earlier bridge spike.

The runtime-off mode clears all accepted targets and stops discovery while leaving the panel, key bind, and lifecycle cleanup available. The registry player gate remains before every adapter and cannot be changed through panel state.

## Packaging

- Package the assigned non-zero chunk from the pinned PMK.
- Rename the produced chunk to `PalworldResourceESP.pak`.
- Install it under `Pal/Content/Paks/LogicMods`.
- Never add the `_P` suffix; that suffix is reserved for patch paks.
- The panel checkpoint contains exactly ten mounted asset files: five `.uasset` and five `.uexp` files, with no runtime DLL.

See `.claude/PRPs/plans/blueprint-bridge-spike.plan.md` and ADR-0002 for the pinned build environment and validation requirements.
